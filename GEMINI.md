# Project Overview

This is a simple, bilingual static website for the music producer "napbak" (Napoleon Baca). The project is built using HTML and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Project Structure

*   `/src`: Contains the source files.
    *   `index.html`: The main page in Spanish.
    *   `en.html`: The English version of the site.
    *   `styles.css`: The input CSS file with Tailwind directives and custom styles.
*   `/public`: Contains the distributable files. This directory is generated by the build process.
*   `package.json`: Defines the project's dependencies and scripts.
*   `tailwind.config.js`: The configuration file for Tailwind CSS.
*   `postcss.config.js`: The configuration file for PostCSS.

## Building and Running

### Dependencies

This project uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage dependencies. To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Building the project

To build the project, run the following command. This will generate the `public` directory with the compiled CSS and copied HTML files.

```bash
npm run build
```

### Running the project

To view the website, open the `index.html` or `en.html` file from the `public` directory in a web browser. For a better development experience, you can use a simple HTTP server or a live-server extension in your code editor.

## Development Conventions

*   **Styling**: The project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) v3.3.3 for styling. All styles are defined in `src/styles.css` and compiled to `public/styles.css`.
*   **SEO**: The site includes extensive metadata for SEO, including a `Person` schema from schema.org to describe the artist to search engines and AI.
*   **Internationalization**: The site is bilingual, with separate HTML files for Spanish (`index.html`) and English (`en.html`). Links are provided in the footer of each page to switch between languages.
